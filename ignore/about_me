I grew up in a small, mountainous city in southwest China.  As a kid, I was lucky to enjoy the great food and beautiful natural scences as a kid.  But at the same time, I was also cultivated with many backwards (better words?) values, like the best way to achieve my value as a woman is to look pretty, and marry well. Conflicting values, clash between my aspirations.  Strange as it might sound, my academic achievement came with..  Long history of fighting depression and anxiety from a young age, and am an advacate for mental health and a more balanced life. Hong Kong years volunteer in local community and training.  
Wide range of interests, music, traveling, meeting and talking to new people.  Food and cooking. 
Jenny!
