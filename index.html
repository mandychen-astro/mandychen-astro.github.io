							<p>My current research focuses on observations of the diffuse circumgalactic medium (CGM) using wide-field, integral-field spectrographs such as VLT/MUSE and Keck/KCWI. In particular, I seek to better understand the dynamical state of the CGM, and its connection to the star-formation/AGN activities of galaxies and the cosmic baryon cycle in general. I also have extensive experience in lens modeling of strong gravitational lensing clusters.

											I'm also a member of the <a href="CUBS website">Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS)</a> collaboration (PI: Hsiao-Wen Chen).  I reduced the <a href="link to MUSE">VLT/MUSE</a> IFU data for all 15 CUBS QSO fields, and have been actively involved in projects analyzing CGM emission detected in the 3D IFU datacubes. So far CUBS have published <a href="paper I link">four papers</a>, with me as a primary contributing author in all of them. <br>

									<p>  Currently I'm working on a paper focusing on the velocity structure function measurements of extended optical nebulae illuminated by QSOs, aiming to find evidence (or lack thereof) for established turbulence in the line-emitting CGM. I've also tremendously enjoyed working with IFU data, and am always happy to chat about data reduction/analyses, line feature fittings, machine learning (especially deep neural networks), strong lensing, and any combination/synergy of these topics.  </p>

							<p>
								Outside of my research life, I enjoy traveling, hiking, meeting new people, trying out new food and drinks, and just being around friends in general.  I've had many hobbies involving music (piano and drum), painting (watercolor and fabric painting) and crafting (knitting and crochet).  Though none of them stuck with me in the long term, they had sparked so much joy in my life (did I forget to mention the brief Marie Kondo phase I had :P), and wondering what I should do next while typing this. During the pandemic I adopted my little cat Jenny, who alternates between being feisty and cuddly, and I love her deeply.   

								I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou">Guizhou province</a> in southwest China, a place relatively underdeveloped in terms of economics and education, but with gorgeous mountainous landscapes and rich cultural heritage from multiple ethnic Chinese minorities.  I studied at <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">the University of Hong Kong (HKU)</a> and graduated with a B.Sc. in physics and an M.Phil. in astronomy.

								During my college years I struggled a lot with depression after losing my father to a sudden heart attack, which prompted me to start receiving cognitive behavior therapy and have since then benefited significantly from it.  This experience inspired my interest in psychology and I decided to enroll in a Master in Psychology program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong right after college.  However I soon discovered that a career in psychology does not suit my ... , and I withdrew from the program half way and returned to doing research in astrophysics, first finished an MPhil at HKU and then moved on to the current PhD program.

								Growing up in an underdeveloped province in mainland China, I did not start learning English until I was 12. I have always been 

								Perhaps not surprisingly, I'm an advocate for awareness of mental health issues and try my best to encourage people around me to get help."but the disease had me.." My experiences with living in mainland China, Hong Kong and the US have opened my eyes to the complexity of different political narratives and their deep, and sadly often tragic impacts on people's lives, while I'm still struggling to find my voice under the current climate. -->
